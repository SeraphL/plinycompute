# This file contains the IP addresses of the worker nodes in a cluster
# of PlinyCompute. The IP address of the manager node is not required.

# By default it includes one entry "localhost:8109"
# This launches a pseudo cluster. Where the nodes are simulated as
# separate processes: a) the manager node (listening on port 8108),
# and b) one worker node listening on port 8109.

# For a real cluster deployment, comment or remove the "localhost:8109"
# line below and add the public IP addresses of the worker nodes in the
# cluster, one IP per line (without the colon and port).

localhost:8109
