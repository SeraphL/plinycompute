\begin{abstract}
This paper describes \emph{PlinyCompute}, a system for development of
high-performance, data-intensive, distributed computing tools and libraries.
Currently, there is a big gap in performance and functionality between 
high-performance computing platforms such as OpenMP and MPI, which provide little direct support for
managing very large datasets, and dataflow platforms such as Spark and Flink.  Spark and Flink
are built to process large datasets but are themselves constructed on top of the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and hence must
at least partially cede performance-critical concerns such as 
memory management (including layout and de/allocation) and virtual
method/function dispatch to the JVM. 
%Since memory management 
%and the frequency of virtual function calls are
%among the most important factors determining system performance,
%this can have a very high cost.

PlinyCompute (or PC for short) is designed to occupy the space between these two 
existing classes of systems, providing high-performance, distributed, data-oriented computing with an expressive,
object-oriented programming interface.
PC differs from other systems in that \emph{in the large}, it presents the programmer with a very high-level,
declarative interface, relying on automatic, relational-database style optimization to figure out how to stage
distributed computations.  However, \emph{in the small}, PlinyCompute
presents the capable systems programmer with a persistent object data model and API (the ``PC object model'') and associated memory management system
that has been designed from the ground-up for
high performance distributed, data-intensive computing.
%PC's execution engine is not merely implemented on top of
%PC object model.  Rather, the two have been co-designed to offer the best possible efficiency.
This hybrid approach---declarative in the large, trusting the programmer's ability
to utilize PC object model efficiently
in the small---results in a system that is ideal for the development of reusable, data-intensive tools and libraries.
Through extensive benchmarking, we show that implementing non-trivial, library-style computations 
on top of PC can result in a speedup of 2$\times$ to
more than 
50$\times$ or more compared to equivalent implementations on Spark.
