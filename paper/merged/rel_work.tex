\section{Related Work}

The PC project was inspired by works from a broad class of
fields, including database engines, distributed in-memory processing
frameworks,  programming languages and compilers. PC is
mainly aiming at providing domain-experts a convenient platform to build high
performance tools and libraries. PC distinguishes itself with existing
works in following aspects:
(1) it combines a highly declarative object-oriented interface with a
low-level native
C++-based query engine, (2) it builds a unique PC Object Model on top of
native C++ to move objects around a distributed system with no
serialization/deserialization costs, (3) it uses a unique TCAP compiler to generate vectorized
pipeline code with thread-local memory management for executing
user-defined object-oriented queries.

\subsection {In-memory Query Processing Systems}
Vector processing and just-in-time compilation techniques are widely
used in modern in-memory query
processing. VectorWise~\cite{zukowski2012vectorwise}, which was
commercialized as the MonetDB/X100 project, makes use of vectorized
query execution to amortize the virtual function call overhead and
also to exploit SIMD support on modern hardware.
Hyper~\cite{neumann2011efficiently} proposed a different code
generation strategy for query compilation to translate relational
algebra to LLVM assembler for execution. This approach gained
popularity in a number of database
engines. LegoBase~\cite{klonatos2014building} switched the interface
from declarative SQL to high-level language (Scala) and uses a query engine
written in Scala as a code generator to emit specialized and low-level
C code for execution. TupleWare~\cite{crotty2015tupleware} also supports
high-level language (any language with an LLVM compiler) interfaces
and aims to
optimize for UDFs by utilizing code
generation technique to integrate UDF code with the framework
code. Voodoo~\cite{pirk2016voodoo} served as an alternative backend for
relational databases like MonetDB and Hyper. It used a new
declarative algebra as the compilation target for query plans to
enable tuning for hardware specifics like caches, SIMD registers,
GPU and so on. Weld~\cite{palkar2017weld} is a recent system proposed
to have a common runtime for data anlytics libraries by asking library
developers to express their work using a new intermediate
representation and asking application developers to use new APIs to
call different libraries.
